1. Mechs (entborg specifically?) can never catch forest on fire? Might be too much a nerf on tree-venge
2. Make entborg a cyborg?
3. Friendly fire doesn't trigger forest armor
4. violent growth choose spot to expand to?
5. Rework/balance forest firer upgrades
6. WtF 0 cost
7. Add weapons to pool
8. Forest fire burrow effect?
