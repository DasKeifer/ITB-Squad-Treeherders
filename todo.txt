TODO this release:

Next release candidates:
1. Mechs (entborg specifically?) can never catch forest on fire? Might be too much a nerf on tree-venge
2. Make entborg a cyborg?
3. violent growth choose spot to expand to?
4. Forest fire burrow effect?
5. Treevac doesn't distinguish between damage in the attack that causes the push vs follow on attacks when checking for spaces to push to
6. Violent growth attack cancelled when attacking allies
